# HDR UK Text Resources

A curated list of applications and datasets for healthcare text analytics developed and shared by the Health Data Research (HDR) UK Text community. Further details of the HDR UK Text project can be found at [hdruk-text.org](https://hdruk-text.org/).  

If you'd like to contribute a resource, please message us at info@hdruk-text.org.

## Applications  

* [CALIBER drugdose](http://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1598): Medication dosage instructions in electronic health records are often in the form of text rather than numbers. This program is designed to convert the text into numbers for the dose, frequency, units, duration etc.    
* [CogStack](https://cogstack.org/): CogStack is designed to operationalise unstructured data resources. It is a locally deployable, distributed, microservice architecture intended to make information retrieval/extraction easier from EHRs.   
* [EdIE-viz](https://github.com/Edinburgh-LTG/edieviz): EdIE-viz provides an interface for stroke-related clinical concept recognition and negation detection in brain radiology reports.    
* [Free text matching algorithm](https://github.com/anoopshah/freetext-matching-algorithm): This computer program is designed to extract diagnoses, dates, durations, laboratory results and selected examination findings (heart rate and blood pressure) from unstructured free text. The program was created based on text in general practice records from the Vision system, and information is encoded using Read Clinical Terms.    
* [Komenti](https://github.com/reality/Komenti): Komenti uses background knowledge that researchers have already discovered about biology and medicine. It combines and uses this knowledge in new ways, with the aim to learn even more from sources that are usually difficult for computers to understand. For example, it can extract information about a patient and the illnesses they are suffering from letters written by their doctor.    
* [Med7](https://github.com/kormilitzin/med7):  dedicated named entity and recognition system to identify 7 categories: dosage, drug, duration, form, frequency, route and strength.  
* [MedCAT](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCAT): A medical concept annotation system that can be used to extract, structure and organize Health Records. It is based on unsupervised learning with the option of online/supervised learning via the [MedCATtrainer interface](https://github.com/CogStack/MedCATtrainer).    
* [SemEHR](https://github.com/CogStack/CogStack-SemEHR): SemEHR is a text mining and semantic search system designed for Surfacing Semantic Data from Clinical Notes in Electronic Health Records for Tailored Care, Trial Recruitment and Clinical Research.    

## Datasets  

* [Biomedical ambiguities: abbreviations and gene names](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/M.Stevenson/resources/BioWSD/corpora/): Corpora containing examples of two ambiguities from the biomedical domain (abbreviations and gene names).    
* [Cardiovascular research abstracts](http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/M.Stevenson/resources/bio_contradictions/): Corpus containing examples of potentially contradictory claims from Medline abstracts describing cardiovascular research intended as a useful resource for researchers working on similar problems.
